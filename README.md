# 🚀 My C Programming Journey

Welcome to my personal C workspace! This repository is a collection of my daily practice sessions, logic building, and deep dives into the fundamentals of C programming.

## 🛠️ What I Have Practiced

### 📂 [1] Function Types Exploration
I implemented a **Prime Number Checker** using four different architectures to master how data flows through a program.

| Pattern | Type | Responsibility | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Type I** | No Arg, No Return | Self-contained logic inside function | ✅ |
| **Type II** | No Arg, With Return | Input in function, sends result to main | ✅ |
| **Type III** | With Arg, No Return | Input in main, result printed in function | ✅ |
| **Type IV** | With Arg, With Return | **The Pro Way** (Pure logic & reusability) | ✅ |

### 📂 [2] Recursive Logic
I am refining my understanding of the "Function Stack" by solving problems using recursion:
* **Sum of Natural Numbers:** Calculating total values by calling a function within itself.
* **Base Case Mastery:** Designing exit conditions to prevent infinite loops.



### 📂 [3] Core Foundations
As seen in my project explorer, I have completed practical implementations for:
* **Control Flow:** `If-Else` and `Switch-case` logic (Leap Year, Vowel checks).
* **Loops:** `For`, `While`, and `Do-while` structures (Factorials, GCD).
* **Number Theory:** Palindrome checks, Fibonacci sequences, and Prime logic.
* **Character Handling:** Character alphabets and digit counting.

## 🧠 What I Have Learned

> [!TIP]
> **Modular Coding:** Breaking code into small, specialized functions makes it much easier to debug and reuse across different projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Git Best Practices:** I've learned how to use `.gitignore` to keep my repository professional by hiding binary files and keeping only the source code.

* ✅ **Clean Formatting:** Using VS Code shortcuts (`Shift + Alt + F`) to maintain perfect indentation.
* ✅ **Optimization:** Using `break` statements to stop loops early once a condition is met.
* ✅ **Problem Solving:** Learning how to turn a word problem into a logical algorithm.
